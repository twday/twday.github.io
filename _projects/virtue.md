This project is employing cutting edge Virtual Reality technology and the latest Games Engine capabilities to assist in the cognitive rehabilitation of stroke patients by allowing them to practice Activities of Daily Living in a safe environment, while getting immediate and meaningful feedback on their performance. The application is also designed to be adjustable so it can be configured to the patients current abilities.
