An extension for Visual Studio Code designed to make writing and maintaining BibTeX files easier.

This was initially written during my Ph.D. to help sort entries in Bib files to make them easier to search. I recently updated the extension to take advantage of the Language Server system in VS Code to provide Intellisense features such as code completion and linting.
