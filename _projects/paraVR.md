This project uses modern virtual reality technology to help paramedics train and practice essential procedures that they may not used very often, such as a Cricothyroidotomy.

The application was built for the Oculus Rift and uses desktop-based haptic devices, such as the sensable haptic device, to replicate the forces experienced when perform the procedures to increase the immersion of the training scenarios.
