Virtual Reality application built for Science Outreach events at the University of Manchester. Its purpose was to help teach children about the different parts of the brain and the specific functions using an engaging medium where they could interact with the brain, pull it apart and bring up information about the sections.

The VR app was originally designed for use with the Oculus Go as there were no apps available on the app store that were appropriate or had easy controls for school-aged children.

The app was later ported over to the Oculus Quest, taking advantage of the more immersive experience and better interactions.
